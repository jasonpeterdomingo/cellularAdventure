The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) comprises networks of membranous tubules and sacs. 
It has two regions: rough ER and smooth ER. 
The rough ER is studded with ribosomes on its surfaceâ€”plays an essential role in folding, transporting, and processing newly created proteins. 
The smooth ER is primarily responsible for lipid synthesis, detoxification, and the storage of calcium ions.
