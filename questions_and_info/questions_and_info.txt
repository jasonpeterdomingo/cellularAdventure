Nucleus Info: 
Stores the genetic material (DNA) of the cell into structures called chromosomes
The nuclear envelope separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm and regulates the movement of molecules in and out of the nucleus
Inside the nucleus, DNA is transcribed into a primary transcript
Primary transcript undergoes RNA processing (converts the primary transcript into mRNA)
The mRNA then exits the nucleus via the nuclear pores, ready for translation (protein synthesis)

Q: The cell's genetic material is stored in structures called what? 
    a. Cytoplasm 
    b. Nuclear pores
    c. mRNA
    d. Chromosomes

Q: All of the following are the functions of the nuclear envelope EXCEPT?
    a. Separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm 
    b. Regulates the movement of molecules traveling into the nucleus 
    c. Regulates the movement of molecules traveling out of the nucleus 
    d. Translate mRNA into proteins 

Q: True or False? mRNA exits the nucleus through the nuclear pores.

Endoplasmic Reticulum Info:
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) comprises networks of membranous tubules and sacs.
Two regions: rough ER and smooth ER
The rough ER is studded with ribosomes on its surfaceâ€”plays an essential role in folding, transporting, and processing newly created proteins
The smooth ER is primarily responsible for lipid synthesis, detoxification, and the storage of calcium ions

Q: Which of the following is the function of ribosomes?
    a. Processing newly created proteins 
    b. Lipid synthesis 
    c. Detoxification 
    d. Storage of calcium ions 

Q: True or False? The smooth ER is studded with ribosomes. 

Q: True or False? One function of the smooth ER is the detoxification.

Mitochondria Info: 
Referred to as the powerhouses of the cell
A double-membraned organelle
Primarily responsible for producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the cell's main source of energy
Folding of the inner membrane increases the surface area, which allows for more ATP to be made

Q: True or False? The mitochondria is a single-membraned organelle. 

Q: All of the following are true for the mitochondria EXCEPT?
    a. Produces ATP 
    b. Refers to as the powerhouses of the cell
    c. Folding of inner membrane allows more more ATP to be made 
    d. Stores calcium ions

Golgi Complex Info:
The Golgi complex processes, modifies, and packages proteins and lipids synthesized by the cell
Adds or removes chemical groups, sorts molecules, and packages them into vesicles for transport to various cell destinations
Ensures that cellular molecules are properly modified and directed to their functional locations.

Q: All of the following are functions of the Golgi apparatus EXCEPT?
    a. Packages of proteins and lipids 
    b. Add or remove chemical groups
    c. Sort molecules and package them into vesicles 
    d. Synthesizes proteins and lipids 

Q: True or False? The Golgi apparatus ensures that the cellular molecules are properly modified are transported to their function locations.
