The nucleus stores the genetic material (DNA) of the cell into structures called chromosomes. 
The nuclear envelope separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm and regulates the movement of molecules in and out of the nucleus. 
Inside the nucleus, DNA is transcribed into a primary transcript. 
Primary transcript undergoes RNA processing (converts the primary transcript into mRNA). 
The mRNA then exits the nucleus via the nuclear pores, ready for translation (protein synthesis).
